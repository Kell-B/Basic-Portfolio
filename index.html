        <p> Hi, my name is Kell Banks. I'm currently a student of the University
        of Utah web development bootcamp. By the end of the program I hope to
        have obtained the skills to become employed as a fullstack web
        developer. It has been a challenging learning experience so far, but I
        look forward to the journey! </p>
        
        <p> I'm currently living in Spanish Fork, Utah. I enjoy spending my time
        with my girlfriend of 6yrs Adri and my 5yr old aussie Piper. Some of my
        interests include listening to and playing music, photography, cooking,
        reading, art, and science. </p>
